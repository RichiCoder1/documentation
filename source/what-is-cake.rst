What is Cake?
-------------

Cake is a build automation system with a C# DSL to do things like compiling code, copy files/folders, running unit tests, compress files and build NuGet packages.

Goals
-----

The goal of Cake is to be a first class alternative to those who want to write their build scripts in C# instead of Ruby, F# or Powershell.
